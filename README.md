# Handwritten Digit Predictor

This repo houses the frontend for a custom handwritten digit predictor program. This frontend goes along with the backend (written in Python using Flask and PyTorch). 
The backend for the site can be found [here](https://github.com/lla1dlaw/MNIST_Inference_Microservice).

This site is not currently being hosted (as I don't have the funds to do so) but it is fully functional. In the future I want to add the user to upload their own models in various formats for 
comparison purposes, however that may not be viable. I also wanted to add an activation graph of all the individual neurons in each network. Stay tuned for those features in the future!
